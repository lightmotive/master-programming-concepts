# Robots

## Encapsulation and scalability

This small program was inspired by Launch School's [Robot Name exercise](https://launchschool.com/exercises/9302dd42).

My [original solution](https://github.com/lightmotive/ls-rb130-exercises/blob/main/07_challenges/medium/robot.rb) and [alternative solution](https://github.com/lightmotive/ls-rb130-exercises/blob/main/07_challenges/medium/robot_alt.rb) both touched on encapsulation and scalability.

Here, I further explore encapsulation and, to a lesser degree, scalability.
